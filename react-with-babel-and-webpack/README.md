## Instructions

*This demo app is a work in progress*

1. Run both `npm install` and `bower install` in  *this* directory and also both `react-wrapper` and `ui-kit-preview` packages 
1. Navigate to the react-wrapper package, and start the webpack-hot server via `npm run hot-server`. This will start webpack
 and recompile the React JSX code when one of the component files changes. You should see your compiled React code in `packages/react-wrapper/panel/dist`
1. Navigate back to Editor-Framework root and run `npm run start ./example-apps/work-with-react`

## TODO
- Better and simpler code organization needed
- Simplify dev dependencies
- Not all CSS styles are working on React components
